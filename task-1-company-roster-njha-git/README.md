### Some things to keep in mind
- The problem statement is very loosely described to encourage questions. Feel free to point out discrepancies in the code
- Ye college assignment nahi hai! I will help you solve things you find tricky. But do approach stackoverflow and google first.
- Feel free to use AI tools as long as you know what you're doing.
